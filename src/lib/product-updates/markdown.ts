/**
 * docs.unity.com went client-rendered: its HTML shell now carries zero
 * `h1`/`h2`/`h3` elements, and the article body only survives inside a
 * React Flight payload as *compiled MDX JavaScript*
 * (`_jsx(_components.li, …)`) - source code, not serialised data, so the
 * Flight decoder in `src/lib/ingest/rsc-flight.ts` can't recover it and
 * a regex over compiled JSX would be exactly the pattern-matching that
 * CLAUDE.md forbids.
 *
 * Every affected page does publish a markdown twin at `<url>.md`
 * (`text/markdown`), whose `#`/`##`/`###` + list structure maps onto the
 * same DOM shape the adapters were already written against. So we render
 * that markdown to HTML here and hand it to the existing parsers
 * unchanged - the site's rewrite costs us one conversion step instead of
 * twelve rewritten adapters.
 *
 * The raw markdown is what gets stored as the snapshot, so evidence stays
 * verbatim and a replay re-runs this conversion rather than trusting a
 * derived artefact.

/**
 * Fold Unity's multi-line table cells back into single-line GFM rows.
 *
 * GFM has no syntax for a multi-line cell, so the docs exporter emits
 * the first line of a Notes cell inside the row and dumps the rest -
 * bullets, nested bullets, blank lines, run-on prose - as bare lines
 * after it, until the next `|` row. marked closes the table at the first
 * of those lines, so LevelPlay kept 1 of ~60 rows and Unity Ads lost
 * every platform row that followed a multi-line cell. The three
 * validation floors caught it: "returned 1 record; expected 15" and
 * "count dropped 52.3%".
 *
 * Grammar, taken from the real exports (levelplay/sdk/<platform>/changelog,
 * grow/ads/changelog): a table starts at a header row followed by a
 * delimiter row; every later line that starts with `|` is a new row;
 * anything else belongs to the current row's last cell until a heading
 * or end of document. Rows carry no closing pipe. Bullet markers are
 * stripped and lines joined by spaces, which is what `.text()` on the
 * old rendered <td><ul><li> gave the parsers, so item bodies and keys
 * stay stable. A literal `|` inside a folded line is escaped so it can't
 * split the cell.
